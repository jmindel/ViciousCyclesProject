                "description": "Get down in the city with the Redux 2! Ready to commute, hit the pub, or ride home from a show, the Redux 2 is up for the challenges of street riding. There is no such thing as a predictable surface when it comes to riding in the city. You encounter countless obstacles from potholes and manhole covers to train tracks, curbs, grates and everything in between. The Redux 2 is the bike that can handle it all. Nimble like a mountain bike but made for the street, this best-selling bike is the ultimate multiuse machine. Plus, it’s fast and clean. Designed with a lightweight aluminum frame and fork, the Redux 2 is light enough to lift up steep stairs to an apartment but durable enough for hardcore city use. You get 9 speeds, a larger diameter handlebar, and hydraulic disc brakes for optimal stopping power. This bike is smooth-shifting and low-maintenance with the ultimate braking power in wet and dirty conditions. Big all-terrain tires roll over almost anything in their path. Clean lines, sporty graphics, minimal logos and overall good looks also make the Redux 2 a top pick.",
